SinCraft
===============

Minecraft Classic Custom Server Software


This is a small side project by Sinjai, adding/improving features that were in MCForge.
This server software is being created for my own enjoyment, not for actual use (although it will be available for use, and nothing is stopping you if you compile the solution). That being said, I do plan on hosting a server sometime in the future by the name of SinCraft, using this server software, so feel free to pop in and say hello!
